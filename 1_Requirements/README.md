High level Requirements:
                        The game manages every position of snakes,ladders and manage the position of the player.
                        If by chance player excedes position over hundered then it would not consider that move and player has to wait for his turn.

Low level Requirements:
                       A random Dice number will be generated in the range of 1-6.
                       If player gets number '6' he gets another chance to roll again.
